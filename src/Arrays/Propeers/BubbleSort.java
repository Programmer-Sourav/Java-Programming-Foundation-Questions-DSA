 * Bubble Sort is one of the sorting algorithms that works by repeatedly

/**
 * Problem: Bubble Sort
 * We are given an unsorted array of N non-negative integers.
 * We need to sort it in non-decreasing order (ascending) using Bubble Sort.
 * ðŸ”‘ Key Idea of Bubble Sort
 * Compare adjacent elements.
 * If the current element is greater than the next element â†’ swap them.
 * After each iteration, the largest element moves ("bubbles up") to the end.
 * Repeat this until the array is sorted.
