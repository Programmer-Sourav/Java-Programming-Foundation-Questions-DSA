/**
 * Problem statement You are given â€˜Nâ€™ integers in the form of an array â€˜ARRâ€™.
 * Print the sorted array using the insertion sort. Note : No need to return anything.
 * You should sort the array in-place. For example : Let â€˜ARRâ€™ be: [1, 4, 2]
 * The sorted array will be: [1, 2, 4].
 */

/**
 * âš¡ Time Complexity:
 * Worst Case: O(N^2) (when array is reverse sorted)
 * Best Case: O(N) (when array is already sorted)
 * In-place and stable sorting.

/**
 * Step-by-step â€” Insertion Sort
 * Insertion sort builds a sorted portion of the array one element at a time by taking the next element (the key) and inserting it into the correct position among the previously-sorted elements (by shifting larger elements right). Itâ€™s intuitive, stable, in-place, and runs very fast on nearly-sorted arrays.
 * Short algorithm
 * For i from 1 to n-1:
 * key = arr[i]
 * Compare key with elements to its left (arr[i-1], arr[i-2], ...)
 * Shift any element > key one position to the right
 * Insert key at the position freed
 */

/**
 * Properties & complexity
 *
 * Time:
 *
 * Worst / Average: O(nÂ²) (many shifts)
 *
 * Best (already sorted): O(n) â€” only comparisons, no shifts
 *
 * Space: O(1) (in-place)
 *
 * Stable: yes â€” equal elements keep original order
 *
 * Adaptive: fast when array is nearly sorted
 *
 * Online: can sort as elements arrive (useful for streaming insertion)

/**
 * ðŸ”¹ Algorithm (high-level)
 *
 * For each index i from 1 to n-1:
 *
 * Save key = arr[i].
 *
 * Use binary search on arr[0..i-1] to find the correct insertion position.
 *
 * Shift elements right to make room for key.
 *
 * Insert key.
 */

/**
 * Complexity
 *
 * Comparisons: O(log n) per insertion (binary search).
 *
 * Shifts: still O(n) in worst case (shifting large parts of array).
 *
 * Overall: O(nÂ²) but with fewer comparisons than normal Insertion Sort.
 *
 * Space: O(1) (in-place).
 *
 * Stable: Yes (if you place equal elements after duplicates).

/**
 * ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s happening?
 *
 * When we find the position (loc) where key should be inserted, all elements **from loc to i-1** must be shifted one step right to make space for key`.
 *
 * Thatâ€™s where j-- comes in.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Example
 *
 * Array = [2, 4, 5, 6, 1]
 * Weâ€™re at i = 4 â†’ key = 1
 * Binary search says â†’ loc = 0
 *
 * Now:
 *
 * Start with j = i - 1 = 3 (arr[3] = 6)
 *
 * While j >= loc (0):
 *
 * arr[j+1] = arr[j]
 *
 * Then j--
 *
 * Step-by-step:
 *
 * j=3 â†’ arr[4] = arr[3] â†’ [2, 4, 5, 6, 6]
 * j=2 â†’ arr[3] = arr[2] â†’ [2, 4, 5, 5, 6]
 * j=1 â†’ arr[2] = arr[1] â†’ [2, 4, 4, 5, 6]
 * j=0 â†’ arr[1] = arr[0] â†’ [2, 2, 4, 5, 6]
 *
 *
 * Now j = -1 â†’ exit loop.
 * Finally â†’ arr[loc] = key â†’ [1, 2, 4, 5, 6].
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Why j--?
 *
 * Because we are moving leftward:
 *
 * First shift element at index 3 â†’ move it to index 4.
 *
 * Then shift element at index 2 â†’ move it to index 3.
 *
 * Then shift element at index 1 â†’ move it to index 2.
 *
 * Keep going until we reach the insertion spot.
 *
 * If we didnâ€™t do j--, the loop would get stuck at the same index.
 *
 * âœ… So j-- means: keep shifting elements leftward until the correct position is freed for key.
