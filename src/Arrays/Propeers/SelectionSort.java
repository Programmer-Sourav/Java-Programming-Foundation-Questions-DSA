/**
 * Problem: Selection Sort
 * Selection Sort is one of the sorting algorithms that works by repeatedly finding
 * the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning.
 * You are given an unsorted array consisting of N non-negative integers.
 * Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the Selection Sort algorithm.

/**
 * ðŸ”‘ Pattern / Approach
 * Pattern: Sorting (Comparison based)
 * Time Complexity:
 * Worst & Average Case: O(NÂ²) (because of two nested loops)
 * Best Case: O(NÂ²) (still has to go through all comparisons even if sorted)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)
